This project was implemented on the Spark platform to anticipate employee retention within an organization. It aims to accurately predict whether an employee is likely to maintain their employment within the company or choose to leave. Through this predictive model, the organization can gain valuable insights to better manage its workforce and implement strategic measures to enhance employee retention.

In this prediction considered factors spanning personal circumstances, financial conditions, and job satisfaction play a substantial role in shaping an employee's career decisions, including their likelihood of attrition. 

A comprehensive understanding of these elements not only provides a window into an employee's personal commitments and lifestyle but also highlights the potential influences on their professional choices. As such, these factors warrant careful attention in HR analytics and strategies aimed at minimizing employee turnover.
